			<h2> Arduino Based Self Driving Car With Drowsiness Detection </h2>
			<p> This project is based on we present an Arduino based self-drive car with added software-based 
			features like drowsiness detection, voice control along with line following ability and obstacle 
			detection. The system uses OpenCV-Python to achieve control over the car by voice commands. 
			The drowsiness detector detects the expression of the driver and sends signals to the Arduino board. 
			The Arduino switches the car to self- drive mode depending upon the signal received and it also sends a 
			signal to an app which is linked with it. The app performs the task of sending SOS. It also accounts for 
			controlling the sensors and motors which are responsible for obstacle detection and route following.<p>
			<p>(Sadly, we could not complete the project due to Covid-19 situation)<p>

			<h2> Iot based Smart Parking System </h2>
			<p> This project is an Internet of Things (IoT) based smart parking system which will manage and update a
	 		database based on availability of parking spaces in different parking slots and display the same to the 
	 		user. The end user can interact with the system through a mobile application which will let the show a 
	 		list of nearby parking spaces and availability of space in each. The user can select the parking lot of 
	 		his choice and book it for himself for some hours which he/she will provide. User bookings get updated 
	 		on the database. To display vacancy status to the user on his/her application, the current occupancy 
			will have to get updated on the database in real time. For this, every parking lot will be fit with two 
	 		IR sensors at a distance of average distance between car wheels which will sense the presence of a car. 
	 		Output of IR sensors will be sent to the database through IoT. This will then be displayed to the end
	  		user on his application. The system will also have RFID based authentication at the parking gate. 
	  		Every user will be provided with a RFID token at entrance which will be scanned at the entrance and 
	  		exit of the parking lot which will cause the motorised gate to open. In this way, we are proposing a
	 		system which can be easily implemented with currently available technology in a cost-effective manner.
	 		Implementation of this system at a larger scale will not only provide a great deal of convenience to 
	 		the end user. </p>
